# Achadinhos Next.js

This project was developed with **Next.js**, and during the process, I learned and applied several technologies and tools.

## Technologies used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static-site generation.
- **Swiper**: A library for creating responsive sliders/carousels with touch navigation support.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests easily and efficiently.
- **EmailJS**: A service that allows sending emails directly from the client-side using JavaScript without the need for a backend server.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, document-oriented database used to store flexible, scalable, high-performance JSON-like data.

## What I learned

1. **Swiper**

   - Building dynamic carousel

2. **Component Layout**
   - Integrating all other main components into one

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
